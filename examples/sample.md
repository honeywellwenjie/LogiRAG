# Sample Document

This is a sample document to demonstrate LogiRAG's indexing capabilities.

## Introduction

LogiRAG is a reasoning-based RAG system that uses hierarchical tree indexing instead of vector embeddings.

### Key Features

- No vector database required
- Human-like document navigation
- LLM-powered reasoning

### How It Works

1. Parse document structure
2. Build tree index
3. Use LLM to navigate and retrieve

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Indexer**: Parses documents and builds tree structure
2. **Retriever**: Uses LLM reasoning to find relevant sections
3. **Server**: Provides API and web interface

### Supported Formats

- Markdown files (.md)
- Text files (.txt)
- Web pages (via URL)

## Conclusion

LogiRAG provides a simple yet powerful alternative to traditional vector-based RAG systems.
